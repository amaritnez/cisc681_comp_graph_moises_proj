To run a specific program, simple run the relevant url

For instance, to run assignment 1 problem 1, type

https://amaritnez.github.io/cisc681_comp_graph_moises_proj/assignment1_1.html


Some programs take in specific parameters in the url, they are as follows:

- Assignment 1 Problem 1
n: the number of sides the polygon will be
rad: the radius of the polygon
innerColor: the color of the inside of the polygon
outerColor: the color of the edge of the polygon

Example with parms: 
https://amaritnez.github.io/cisc681_comp_graph_moises_proj/assignment1_1.html?n=5&innerColor=orange&rad=25&outerColor=indigo

- Assignment 1 Problem 2
n: the number of sides the cylinder will be
rad: the radius of the cylinder
len: the height of the cylinder

Example with parms:
https://amaritnez.github.io/cisc681_comp_graph_moises_proj/assignment1_2.html?n=6&rad=25&len=30


You can add any extra programs to the js folder and run them; you can also 
add javascript programs to the other folders as well.

Programs that require resources may not run from your file system due to permission restrictions. This is true, for example, of programs that load font or texture resources. To run ALL programs, you can either relax security restrictions in your browser or run your files from a local web server. For that, here are some useful links:

The three.js programs from the following site https://sites.nova.edu/mjl/graphics/ will run under this framework.
